# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

 This prework study guide is an application designed to help students in boot camp. They can refer to this whenever they are confused or need help. I built this project as a guide to help us along our journey in boot camp. It serves as a motivation for students to keep pushing forward and helps us learn certain guidelines for our professional career.
